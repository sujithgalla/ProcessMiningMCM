Gap in knowledge:
  The most common type of literature review in psychology is the “gap in knowledge” literature review. 
  This review shows what is k
  nown and what is not known about an empirical problem or area of research. 
  This type of review is easily turned into an introduction for research (in a research proposal, research 
  article or grant proposal) because it justifies why a specific study or grou
  ps of studies should be done.
