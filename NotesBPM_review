 Many of these papers involve the use of heuristic techniques to solve mining loop and noise problems.
 
 The problem of noise in process data has been described by van der Aalst (2004a) as the presence of “incorrectly logged information” within a process log
  - There are two types of noise problems. Incorrect process data attained in the logs and Inaccurate Process Data in the log.
  Incorrect data presents counter process flows.
  Inaccurate data is data that is generated by anamoly processes opportunities in the process. Not well travelled paths.
Problems:
  Noise
  Mining Loops
  Concurrent Processes
  Visualizations
  Duplicate Tasks
  
Entropy gives a measure of the amount of information contained in an event sequence and the number of occurrences of events within a process.

1) Conformance  checking-reflecting  on  the  observed  reality,  i.e.  checking  whether  the  modeled  behavior matches the observed behavior;
2) Process model discovery-constructing complete and compact process models able to reproduce the observed behavior, and
3) Process model extension-projection of information extracted from the logs onto the model, to make the tacit knowledge explicit 
and facilitate better understanding of the process model.
