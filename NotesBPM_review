 Many of these papers involve the use of heuristic techniques to solve mining loop and noise problems.
 
 The problem of noise in process data has been described by van der Aalst (2004a) as the presence of “incorrectly logged information” within a process log
  - There are two types of noise problems. Incorrect process data attained in the logs and Inaccurate Process Data in the log.
  Incorrect data presents counter process flows.
  Inaccurate data is data that is generated by anamoly processes opportunities in the process. Not well travelled paths.
Problems:
  Noise
  Mining Loops
  Concurrent Processes
  Visualizations
  Duplicate Tasks
  
Entropy gives a measure of the amount of information contained in an event sequence and the number of occurrences of events within a process.
